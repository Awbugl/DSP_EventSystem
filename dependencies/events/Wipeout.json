      "ZHCN": "在接近${PlanetName}时，几枚质量加速炮弹从重力井边缘飞驰而过。这些投射物已经有数十亿年的历史了，从轨迹判断，它们似乎是从邻近星系发射的，在偏离原定目标继续默默的飞行了许久-直到今天你看到它们。尽管历史悠久，但我们回收的这些炮弹的设计还是非常尖端的。",
      "ENUS": "While approaching ${PlanetName}, several mass acceleration projectiles zipped past the edge of the gravity well.These projectiles are billions of years old, and judging from their trajectories, they appear to have been launched from a neighboring galaxy and continued to fly silently for a long time after deviating from their original targets-until you see them today. Despite their long history, the design of these projectiles we recovered is still very cutting-edge."
